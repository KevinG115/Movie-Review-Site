When Peter Bash and Jared Franklin, two young attorneys with a no-holds-barred courtroom style, are hired by Stanton Infeld, life at his buttoned-down law firm will never be the same.
Working with their equally oddball staff researcher Pindar Singh and paralegal Carmen Phillips, Franklin and Bash shake things up at the firm with their audacious tactics and immediately
find an enemy in its star lawyer, Infeld's nephew Damien Karp. While the sexual tension between Jared and senior partner Hanna Linden boils over as Peter is breaking up with his longtime 
girlfriend, prosecutor Janie Ross, they continue fighting for the underdogs and ne'er-do-wells as they learn to swim with the sharks in the world of high-stakes corporate law.

An amiable Navy veteran loses his comfortable job at a big-box store, enrolls in community college, and seeks to reinvent himself while falling for his apathetic speech professor in this
romantic comedy reteaming Academy Award-winning CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR co-stars Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts. Larry Crowne (Hanks) has just been downsized. The unfortunate victim of a failing
economy, Larry decides that his best option to avoid becoming idle is to take some classes at his local community college. In no time, Larry befriends a colourful group of moped-obsessed
outcasts on the road to self-improvement, and begins working to sharpen his communication skills in a public speaking class taught by Mercedes Tainot (Roberts). Disenchanted with her job and
bored in her marriage, Mercedes has begun to feel as if she's missing out on life. But whenever she's with Larry, all of her problems seem to disappear. Now, just as Larry and Mercedes are
feeling as if their lives have been put on hold, they both discover that fate sometimes has a way of giving us exactly what we need, at precisely the right time.
