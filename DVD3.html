Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 is the final adventure in the Harry Potter film series. The much-anticipated motion picture event is the second of two full-length parts.
In the epic finale, the battle between the good and evil forces of the wizarding world escalates into an all-out war. The stakes have never been higher and no one is safe. But it is
Harry Potter who may be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice as he draws closer to the climactic showdown with Lord Voldemort.
It all ends here.

The Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, are back in action, taking on the evil Decepticons, who are determined to avenge their defeat in 2009's Transformers Revenge of the Fallen. In this new movie,
the Autobots and Decepticons become involved in a perilous space race between the U.S. and Russia, and once again human Sam Witwicky has to come to the aid of his robot friends.
There's new characters too, including a new villain in the form of Shockwave, a longtime "Transformers" character who rules Cybertron while the Autobots and Decepticons battle it out on Earth.

The FBI's sharpest thinkers have murder on their minds. Outthink the criminals with the FBI's sharpest agents as the sixth season of Criminal Minds arrives on DVD with 24 gripping episodes.
The members of the Behavioural Analysis Unit (BAU) profile uncatchable crooks responsible for unthinkable crimes. Team leader Aaron Hotchner and famed profiling expert David Rossi face a deadly
challenge when a new case threatens one of their own. Special Agent Emily Prentiss takes on an enemy from her past in a game of cat-and-mouse - and nothing will ever be the same.
Yet with Dr. Spencer Reid, Derek Morgan, Jennifer "JJ" Jareau, technical analyst Penelope Garcia and FBI cadet Ashley Seaver on the case, justice is always part of the profile.

She gave her daughter everything. But everything was not enough. HBO's new miniseries Mildred Pierce brings to life the memorable characters introduced in James M. Cain’s classic 1941 novel of pride and
privilege in the middle class. Starring Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet, and co-written and directed by Oscar®-nominated filmmaker Todd Haynes, this five-part drama is an intimate portrait of a
uniquely independent woman who finds herself newly divorced during the Depression years, as she struggles to carve out a new life for herself and her family. The story explores Mildred’s unreasonable
devotion to her insatiable daughter Veda (Evan Rachel Wood), as well as the complex relationship she shares with the indolent men in her life, including her polo-playing lover Monty Beragon (Guy Pearce)
and ex-husband Bert Pierce (Brian F. O'Byrne).
