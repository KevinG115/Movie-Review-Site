For Nick, Kurt and Dale, the only thing that would make the daily grind more tolerable would be to grind their intolerable bosses into dust. Quitting is not an option, so, with the benefit of a
few-too-many drinks and some dubious advice from a hustling ex-con, the three friends devise a convoluted and seemingly foolproof plan to rid themselves of their respective employers...permanently.
There's only one problem: even the best laid plans are only as foolproof as the brains behind them.<br /><br /></td>

RATATOUILLE producer Brad Lewis steps into the director's chair for this sequel that follows racing legend Lightning McQueen and his trusty sidekick, Mater, as they secure their passports and take
part in the biggest race on the planet. As the first-ever World Grand Prix approaches, cars from every continent prepare for the ultimate competition. But who will have what it takes to become the
fastest car on the planet? Just as Lightning McQueen edges up to the starting line, however, his old pal Mater gets sidetracked on a top-secret spy mission that takes him from Japan to Europe as the entire
world watches. Thankfully Mater's friends are always willing to lend a helping wheel, and as the race gets underway, everyone shifts into high gear to help out an old friend.<br /><br /></td>

Beloved zookeeper Griffin Keyes (Kevin James) decides to quit his job to dive in the dating pool, and finds that his animal friends have been harboring an incredible secret in this comedy from director
Frank Coraci (THE WEDDING SINGER, CLICK). Griffin is a single guy who loves his job at the Franklin Park Zoo. He has a special bond with the animals, yet he can't help but feeling lonely each night when
he returns to an empty house. Eventually deciding that a more prestigious job may be the key to finding a new girlfriend, Griffin prepares to turn in his walking papers and reinvent himself. But when
word gets out to the animals that Griffin will soon be leaving, they realise the only way to keep him around is to reveal they have the gift of gab. Perhaps with a little dating advice from his friends in
the animal kingdom, this lonely zookeeper will manage to meet the girl of his dreams without losing the job he loves.<br /><br /></td>

Everyone’s favourite reluctant traveller is back in the departure lounge. But this time Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant are sending Karl Pilkington around the world with a list of the ultimate things
to do before you die. Armed with this definitive bucket list, Karl will be dispatched to far flung corners of the world to swim with dolphins, travel Route 66 and stay on a private desert island, in an
attempt to prove whether these so called ‘things to do before you die’ really are what they’re cracked up to be. After seeing the Seven Wonders, Karl’s not exactly eager to travel again, so he’s only agreed
to do another series if the rules change. Karl wants to choose where he goes and what he does from the Bucket List. Ricky and Steve are both happy to go along with Karl’s wishes to get him through the
departure gates. Once Karl’s back on the road, they’ll be back to their old tricks though, throwing in unwelcome surprises for Karl along the way to make sure he’s always pushed out of his comfort zone…
